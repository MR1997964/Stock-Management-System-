A simple stock management system using Python control flow statements
Stock Management System

This repository contains a simple Python-based stock management system. The code demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts like variables, numerical values, and if-elif-else control statements to manage stock levels in a healthcare service business.

# Features
- The program checks the current stock level against a reorder threshold.
- Depending on the stock level, it provides clear guidance on whether to reorder or if stock levels are sufficient.

# How to Use
- You can modify the current_stock variable to simulate different stock levels and see the results.
- This system is designed for basic stock management but could be extended for more complex use cases like:
  - Integrating with databases or APIs for real-time stock tracking.
  - Adding more complex conditions or scenarios.

# Sample Output
For current_stock = 25 and reorder_threshold = 35 :
